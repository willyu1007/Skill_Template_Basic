# Technical Research Workflow

This guide provides a structured methodology for conducting technical research to support high-quality decision-making and implementation.

## Research Process

### 1. Goal Definition
- Clearly state the problem or question being investigated.
- Identify the constraints (e.g., performance, compatibility, cost).
- Determine what a successful outcome looks like (e.g., a chosen library, a proof-of-concept design).

### 2. Information Gathering
- Search official documentation for relevant technologies.
- Look for community discussions, blog posts, and GitHub issues.
- Evaluate multiple alternatives rather than settling on the first discovery.

### 3. Evaluation and Comparison
- Create a comparison matrix for different solutions based on:
  - **Feature Parity**: Does it meet the requirements?
  - **Maintenance**: Is it actively maintained? How is the community support?
  - **Integration Effort**: How easily does it fit into the existing project structure?
  - **Performance**: Are there known performance issues or benchmarks?

### 4. Proof of Concept (Optional)
- For high-risk or complex solutions, create a minimal reproduction or test script to verify assumptions.
- Document any surprising findings or roadblocks encountered during the POC.

## Output Format for Research Reports
- **Executive Summary**: The recommended direction.
- **Problem Statement**: What was being researched.
- **Options Evaluated**: Summary of the alternatives considered.
- **Pros and Cons**: Detailed breakdown for each option.
- **Recommendation**: Why the specific solution was chosen.
- **Next Steps**: Actionable plan for implementation.
