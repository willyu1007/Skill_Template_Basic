# Skill Retention Table (Template)

Use this template after Stage C to summarize available skills in the conversation. Replace the placeholder rows with actual skills from `.ai/skills/`.

Translate the Description column to the user's preferred language if needed.

Users can list skills they want to delete directly based on this table.

Do NOT save `skill-retention-table.md` as a file; keep the table in-chat only.

## Workflows

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| <skill-name> | <short description> |

## Standards

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| <skill-name> | <short description> |

Notes:
- If multiple skills share the same name, confirm the full path before deleting.
